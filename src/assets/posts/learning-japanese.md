I've been trying to learn Japanese since I was 14. It was always something I wish I could do, and it seemed reasonable, but it was always incredibly daunting. I had no problem studying, but I could never convince myself it was worth it. Every time I started, I would inevitably give up in the span of a few weeks.

In my second year at university, I had the option to take a Japanese module for credit as part of my degree. Since I was having trouble doing it myself, I thought that taking a module would be the perfect push to learn it.

## Getting started

I already knew a substantial amount of Japanese vocabulary; I picked it up just from watching Japanese media and listening to Japanese music. As such, I was pretty good at listening, and could generally understand what people were saying without having studied the language at all. The things I wanted to learn were grammar, speaking and writing.

My class consisted of a number of students from different years and degrees. We had one session, that was 2 hours long, every week, and there was material to learn outside of these classes in preparation for them. Each week, we would go over a new grammar concept, and practice speaking with other people in the class.

## What makes Japanese so hard?

## Kanji

Even if you haven't tried learning Japanese, you've probably heard of Kanji. it's one of three character systems that are used in Japanese, and the average native Japanese speaker knows and uses around 2000 in every day life. These characters are much more complicated, and thus harder to write, than alphanumerics, and therefore much harder to remember.

There is no easy way to learn Kanji. Ultimately, you just have to study consistently until each one sticks. To make things worse, the same Kanji can have different meanings in different contexts, so you have to learn how to use it in sentences as well as just how to write it. That said, there are lots of good resources out there, like [Jisho](https://jisho.org/). It's essentially a Kanji dictionary; you can search for any Kanji and it will show you what it means, how to use it, and how to write it. It's an invaluable resource that I used every day.

## Pitch accent

Intonation refers to the rise and fall of voice in speaking. English is often referred to as a 'flat' language, because individual words don't have any tone; instead, the voice rises and falls depending on the sentence. For instance:

- They were there.
- They were there, weren't they?

These two sentences use different tones, because of what the speaker is trying to get across, but it has nothing to do with the words themselves. Generally when simply stating something, there is little to no tone.

Japanese isn't like that at all. It is a tonal language, which means that for different words the voice should rise and fall differently. Pitch accent is essentially someone's particular intonation, and is the biggest difference between how natural native and non-native speakers sound. Getting this right is hard, and once again takes a lot of practice.

The best way to learn pitch accent is to combine study with practice. Learn the different tones for various words, and then talk to people and have them correct you. With time you'll start to notice patterns, and it'll become easier.

## Learnings

### Overcoming discomfort

At first, I didn't feel comfortable speaking at all, because I wasn't confident in my Japanese (that's why I was there, after all). For me, it was worth it though: going through a short while of being uncomfortable to improve my speaking was a good deal, and eventually I got over that feeling.

Doing so made me realise that, in general, I tend to just stuck to the things I'm good at. Almost everything I've studied in school has been connected to mathematics somehow, since that's what I enjoyed and was the best at, later transitioning into a specific discipline (computer science). I grew a habit of doing this because I wanted to be good at the things I did, but it meant that I gave up opportunities to try and learn new things. The latter is much more important, and learning Japanese set that in stone for me.

### Staying consistent

Perhaps the biggest challenge with learning Japanese was keeping at it. There's a lot to keep track of; learning grammar in a new language is tough, and the Japanese writing system is very complicated, with thousands of characters with foreign shapes that were difficult to write. The only way to learn this sort of thing is to practice day in, day out, and the process really taught me to stay disciplined. It wasn't like other assignments, where I had a set day to be finished by and I could decide when the time was right for me to work on it. 

I had to find time every day, and, while it was difficult at first, I'm very grateful having done it since because it's taught me the importance of discipline in everyday life. Setting a consistent schedule, planning ahead of time and making compromises are all skills I developed in my time learning Japanese.

## Closing thoughts

Whilst I'm by no means finished, learning Japanese has been tough - everything is completely new, and there are no shortcuts. With that said, it's also been incredibly rewarding; being able to pick up a completely new skill and work towards a new goal is a great feeling. For now and the future, I feel confident in my base knowledge of the language to pursue it myself, outside of classes, so that's what I'll be doing. Hopefully, within a few years, I'll be confident enough to call myself fluent in it. Thank you for reading!
